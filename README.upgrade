Note on upgrading from version beta 2:

In the MDBMS beta 3 release, a new password encryption method is used.
This means, that the passwords set in versions previous to beta 3 will
no longer work. Before using newer releases, make sure you delete the
password of the system user, by logging in as the system user and by typing
'set pwd;'.
Now start the new version and reset the passwords.
