General question
================================================================================

I GET A SEGMENTATION FAULT WHEN I START THE DATABASE

This is usually caused by an incorrect version of the dynamic C library.
Check your version by looking at the file /lib/libc.so.
The Linux version of MDBMS is linked with lib.so.5.4.23
The BSD version of MDBMS is linked with libc.so.3.0.
Updating this library will probably solve the problem.


I CAN CONNECT TO THE DATABASE, BUT MY PROGRAMS/MGEN CAN'T

Make sure that there's no firewall blocking ports 2223 AND 2224. Mgen and
other programs connect to port 2224, so it's not enough to open port 2223.


DOES FULL CONTROL OVER A TCP CONNECTION MEAN THAT EVERYBODY ON THE INTERNET
CAN ACCESS/MODIFY MY DATA ?

No, not directly. By default, a table is only readable/writable by the
owner of the database, unless a GRANT statement is used. If you want to
be more secure, you can instruct your firewall to deny TCP connections to
port 2223 and port 2224.


HOW SECURE IS MDBMS ?

MDBMS uses a user based security system. To be able to read or modify data, you
must first switch to a user that has these privileges granted to him. You can
only switch to a user if you supply the correct password. Passwords are stored
in the table 'users' in the meta databases and are encrypted with DES. The
'user' table can only be read by the system user, unless read privileges are
granted to others.


I LOSE DATA AFTER A REBOOT

Some systems kill all processes quickly after a reboot command. After MDBMS
receives a TERM signal, it will start syncing the database to disk. Some
systems don't allow the processes to finish, resulting in data loss. To
solve this problem, you can do two things:
- Make sure the database is killed, before you reboot. You can do this with
  the kill command.
- Send a 'sync' signal to the database, before rebooting. You can do this
  with the 'getdb' command: 'getdb localhost system sync'



How do I .....
================================================================================
TALK TO THE DATABASE

The easiest way to talk to the database is to connect to it with the 'telnet'
utility. Simply type 'telnet localhost 2223' after you've started the database
server.


MAKE A TABLE WORLD READABLE

Grant read privileges to all users with the following command:
  GRANT SELECT ON <table> TO ALL;


BACKUP MY DATA

You can backup your data with the 'dumpdb' utility. More information
can be found in the dumpdb manual page.


What to do if .....
================================================================================
A USER LOST HIS PASSWORD

Follow this procedure:
- Log in as the 'system' user, with 'user system password <pwd>;'
- Change to the user you want to change the password for with 'user <user>;'
- Change his password with 'set pwd=<password>' or delete it with 'set pwd;'


I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF MY DATABASE/TABLE

Open the 'system' database with 'open system;'.
You can now read the table 'tables' with 'select * from tables;'
In this table you'll find the table names in all databases.
